# SpaceInvaders
an old game using pygame and python 3.10


To summary, just enjoy the game (I guessed)
The project has:
- Base code of SpaceInvaders UI (from this tutorial: https://youtu.be/o-6pADy5Mdg) revised by me.
- The UI is nice.
- Level configuration (by me, it's quite interesting, try it and create your own levels)
- Save game state and resume a level (in level.txt after you save a level). You can edit stuffs from that like laser speed, dmg...
- Pictures and audios are not mine (mostly from the tutorial or edited/cropped by me)

And I hope things work out as expected. Thank you. If you find it interesting and want to talk to me, see you in my contact!!!
