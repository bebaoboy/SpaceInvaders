# SpaceInvaders
A remake of an old game using pygame and python 3.10


To summary, just enjoy the game (I guessed) <br>
# The project has:
- Follow a tutorial of SpaceInvaders UI (from this tutorial: https://youtu.be/o-6pADy5Mdg), later expanded a lot by me.
- The UI is nice. Lots of spinning and falling!
- Weapon system: now they're only 5 types of bullet.
- Enemies: many types of enemies, different shooting patterns, toughness and dmg.
- Level configuration (a lot of thing can be configured to make a unique level, designed by me, it's quite interesting, try it and create your own levels)
- Save game state and resume a level (in level.txt after you save a level). You can edit stuffs from that like laser speed, dmg...
- Leaderboards: save your high scores.
- Pictures and audios are not mine (mostly from the tutorial or edited/cropped and added new one by me)
